# A-Cipher
it's a cipher

This uses a three-digit cipher.

I.e 1,5,1 or 2,6,3 etc.

You can:
- type in a string i.e "Hello this is a string".
- use the + or - buttons to encrypt the string.
- use p to print the string to a file called "export.txt" which will be created in the same folder as the script.
- use i to import a string from the same file.

General use case would be :-
TO ENCRYPT:
- Type in the cipher1, cipher2 and cipher3:
1,2,3

- type in a string for somebody:
"Hello this is a string"

- press "+" once to encrypt it once. 
- then press p to export it to "export.txt":
"Igomq#ujlt"lt"d!uwskqh"

---
TO DECRYPT:
- Type in the cipher1, cipher2 and cipher3:
1,2,3

- import the string in "export.txt"
"Igomq#ujlt"lt"d!uwskqh"

- press "-" once to decrypt it once.
- then press p to export it to "export.txt":
"Hello this is a string"
