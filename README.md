# Cipher_a
It's a cipher for fun. 
***NOT FOR SERIOUS PURPOSES***

This uses a three-digit cipher with an index.

I.e 1,5,1 (index 1) or 2,6,3 (index 2) etc.

You can:
- type in a string i.e "Hello this is a string".
- use the + or - buttons to encrypt the string.
- use p to print the string to a file called "export.txt" which will be created in the same folder as the script.
- use i to import a string from the same file.

Use cases:
---
TO ENCRYPT:
- Type in the cipher1, cipher2 and cipher3:
1,2,3

- type in a string for somebody:
"Hello this is a string"

- press "+" once (for index 1) to encrypt it once. 
- then press p to export it to "export.txt":
"Igomq#ujlt"lt"d!uwskqh"

---
TO DECRYPT:
- Type in the cipher1, cipher2 and cipher3:
1,2,3

- import the string in "export.txt"
"Igomq#ujlt"lt"d!uwskqh"

- press "-" once (for index 1) to decrypt it once.
- then press p to export it to "export.txt":
"Hello this is a string"
---
You can encrypt things using multiple indexes as well.
Igomq#ujlt"lt"d!uwskqh = "Hello this is a string" cipher 123, index 1.
Jirns&vlou$ou$g"wztmti = "Hello this is a string" cipher 123, index 2.
Kkuou)wnrv&rv&j#y}uowj = "Hello this is a string" cipher 123, index 3.

All you need to do is decrypt it the same number of times the other person encrypted it.
